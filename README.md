# Which nine games are here?

You'll have heard of the most famous simple board games:
Tic-Tac-Toe, Checkers, Chess, Pong®, Snakes®, Tetris®, Pentominos, and LEGO®

Here, we give you
Tic-Tac-Tuh, Chuckers, Chuss, Pung, Puckmuhn, Snuck, Tetrus, Pentuminuh, and Lugohs

Our simple games think differently.
We fill our games with easter eggs that change the rules of the game to suit you.
We work here to help you exercise this civil right.
We don't know why those people out there deny you this right.
I mean, who should be in charge? Their bots or your people?

Our simple games run today pretty much the same as they did fifty years ago.
The main thing that's changed is that today's Unicode Terminals
invite us to draw large wide dots and squares in nine comic colors

> ⚪ ⚫ 🔴 🔵 🟠 🟡 🟢 🟣 🟤 <br>
> ⬛ ⬜ 🟥 🟦 🟧 🟨 🟩 🟪 🟫 <br>

I like to feel that these Dot over Circle figures are people.  : -)

These figures occupy two Terminal Columns, an even and odd, or an odd and even.
That's new.
The monospaced Glyphs of fifty years ago
all occupied just 1 Column, never 2 Columns.
Sorting these Glyphs by their Unicode Codepoints
puts White Dots left of Black, but Black Squares left of White

Different Fonts will show you the Squares as more or less Square.
I most often test the Andale Mono 18 Font,
which is the default Font of Apple's Terminal in its Homebrew Settings.


# Thinking ahead is allowed


## What's your role in this?

When you try to run these games, they'll talk back,
inviting you to
type on your Keyboard, or
click your Mouse, or
touch your Touch Screen

> ⌃D to quit,  Fn F1 for more help,  or ⌥-Click far from the Cursor<br>

For your convenience, when next you try this again, you can ask for the Gameboard you want, by name
> python3 bin/easter-ugg-studio.py Pung<br>

We hope most of these nine simple games are coming here soon.
Presently we have only the one game, up first


## Actually you do have Linux Online, free of charge

You do have a Linux Online, even while you feel you don't.
It's a bit fiddly, but it comes to you free of charge

It's up for you at
> https://shell.cloud.google.com/?show=terminal

Google gives it away,
buried deep inside of your gMail,
as part of selling their Google Cloud Shell over Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services

Google does give it away, but first they hide it from, you behind three technical lies.

### 1 ) Google's first lie

This free Linux really does work if you try it,
no matter how you choose between "Reject" and "Authorize"
as they come and hassle you with that choice.
Myself, I always choose "Reject".
Why give them power they don't need.

They made their English difficult to understand.
They don't plainly tell you that you can always "Reject" them.
They talk as if you choosing "Reject" will break them

This is their first lie

> Authorize Cloud Shell<br>
> Cloud Shell needs permission to use your credentials to make Google Cloud API calls<br>
> Click Authorize to grant permission to this and future calls<br>

### 2 ) Google's second lie

When you next try to close your Browser or this Browser Window,
after opening your Cloud Shell,
they will pop up again to spark fear in you, by speaking another lie

This is their second lie

> Leave site?
> Changes you made may not be saved

Just leave. They've never lost a change of mine by accident.
I do hope they will never lose a change of yours by accident.
By design, they do often intentionally reverse changes such as 'sudo apt install shellcheck'.
But they've never reverted any 'git clone' of mine, never yet lost a saved game of mine

They will lose an unsaved game of yours,
if you walk away from your Browser Tab without first saving your game,
and then they decide you've lost interest

### 3 ) Google's third lie

They will end by shoving a third lie,
an advert for Google Gemini,
into your face, as you try to leave, as if you need Google Gemini in your life.
But you can just close that lie out too, and move on

You'll have heard of America Online®, founded in 1985.
This is like that. But this is Linux Online, and comes to you free-of-charge


## Got Microsoft Windows or Apple macOS?

You can run these Gameboards like I run them, if you have an iOS or macOS or Linux.
You can run them differently at a Windows

Inside your MacBook, Apple puts the Terminal App inside Finder > Go > Utilities

To run these games at iPad or iPhone, you need to find the Linux inside.
It's only found inside while you're online


## Got Python?

I presume you've got Python, for now is 2025.
You can download a Python if you haven't downloaded a Python already


## Why spell out Egg as U G G?

You'll have heard of Ugg® Boots.
Their work is completely unrelated to ours.
But my father did once greatly please my then-12yo daughter
by buying a pair for her
