## What Makes These Games Different

In place of rigid rules, our games adapt to you.
Each of our games includes Easter Eggs that let you modify gameplay.
So that you control the experience, not the other way around

**Available games**
- **Tic-Tac-Tuh** (Tic-Tac-Toe, but fun)
- **Chuckers** (Checkers inspired)
- **Chuss** (Chess reimagined)
- **Pung** (PongÂ® homage)
- **Puckmuhn** (Pac-ManÂ® style)
- **Snuck** (SnakesÂ® variant)
- **Tetrus** (TetrisÂ® inspired)
- **Pentuminuh** (Pentominos in place of TetrisÂ® TetrominosÂ®)
- **Lugohs** (LEGOÂ®-style building)

**Presently available games**
- Zero games implemented, first game in development


## The Visual Experience

Terminals from today
support colorful Unicode characters that make these games shine

> âšª âš« ðŸ”´ ðŸ”µ ðŸŸ  ðŸŸ¡ ðŸŸ¢ ðŸŸ£ ðŸŸ¤ <br>
> â¬› â¬œ ðŸŸ¥ ðŸŸ¦ ðŸŸ§ ðŸŸ¨ ðŸŸ© ðŸŸª ðŸŸ« <br>

These wide characters (2 Terminal Columns each) come across as lots more square.
They give these games a look that's much more the look of a real board game,
not so much the look of early computing
that you get by trying to draw with only thin characters


## Game Controls

- **âŒƒD** to quit
- **Fn F1** for help
- **âŒ¥-Click** away from the cursor for options
- Keyboard, mouse, and touch screen supported

## Spirit

These games preserve the spirit of classic computing:
simple, hackable, and user-controlled.
While graphics have improved (thanks to Unicode!),
the core experience remains timeless:
games that respond to how you want to play them


## Why "Ugg"?

Just a playful spelling of "Egg" (as in Easter Eggs)
No relation to the boot company.
Though those boots did make one 12-year-old very happy once
