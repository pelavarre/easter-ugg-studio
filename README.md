## What Makes These Games Different

Instead of rigid rules, our games adapt to you. Each includes Easter eggs that let you modify gameplayâ€”because you should control the experience, not the other way around.

**Available games:**
- **Tic-Tac-Tuh** (Tic-Tac-Toe variant)
- **Chuckers** (Checkers-inspired)  
- **Chuss** (Chess reimagined)
- **Pung** (PongÂ® homage)
- **Puckmuhn** (Pac-ManÂ® style)
- **Snuck** (Snake variant)
- **Tetrus** (TetrisÂ® inspired)
- **Pentuminuh** (Pentominos puzzle)
- **Lugohs** (LEGOÂ®-style building)

*Currently: One game fully implemented, others in development*

## The Visual Experience

Modern terminals support colorful Unicode characters that make these games shine:

> âšª âš« ðŸ”´ ðŸ”µ ðŸŸ  ðŸŸ¡ ðŸŸ¢ ðŸŸ£ ðŸŸ¤  
> â¬› â¬œ ðŸŸ¥ ðŸŸ¦ ðŸŸ§ ðŸŸ¨ ðŸŸ© ðŸŸª ðŸŸ«  

These wide characters (2 terminal columns each) create a more visual, board-game feel than the single-column text of earlier eras.

## Controls

- **âŒƒD** to quit
- **Fn F1** for help  
- **âŒ¥-Click** away from cursor for options
- Keyboard, mouse, and touch screen supported

Run a specific game: `python3 bin/easter-ugg-studio.py Pung`

## Installation Options

### macOS/iOS
Find Terminal in **Finder â†’ Go â†’ Utilities**  
For mobile: Use the built-in Linux terminal (requires internet connection)

### Windows
Use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or a terminal emulator

### No Local Install? Try Cloud Shell
Google offers a free Linux environment at: https://shell.cloud.google.com/?show=terminal

*Note: You can always click "Reject" on authorization promptsâ€”the shell works either way. Ignore warnings about unsaved changes when closing; your git clones and saved games persist between sessions.*

## Philosophy

These games preserve the spirit of classic computingâ€”simple, hackable, and user-controlled. While graphics have improved (thanks to Unicode!), the core experience remains timeless: games that respond to how you want to play them.

## Why "Ugg"?

Just a playful spelling of "Egg" (as in Easter eggs). No relation to the boot companyâ€”though those boots did make one 12-year-old very happy once.
